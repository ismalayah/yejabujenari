It was neither an easy nor idyllic one as his parents’ relationship was regularly volatile. His father, O’Neal, regularly used drugs and his mother, Fawcett, would often drink to cope with her problems in Hollywood.</p><p data-characters=478 data-current-count=478 data-injectable=true>Once, Ryan O’Neal even <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shot at Redmon’s half-brother</a> Griffin, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">purposely missing</a> yet adding to a backlog of traumatic memories for Redmond and his family. Regrettably, Redmond learned bad habits from his parents and has an arrest record to prove it. He was arrested in 2008 for a DUI and drug possession. In 2011, he was arrested for heroin possession and in 2015, he violated his probation and was sentenced to three years in jail, eventually being released in 2016.</p><p data-characters=207 data-current-count=207 data-injectable=false>Redmond often blamed his disorderly childhood for his crimes and addictions. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RadarOnline</a>, he even said the mere reality of having celebrity parents put an unfair burden on his shoulders:</p><p>“It’s not the drugs that have been a problem, it’s the psychological trauma of my entire life — my whole life experiences have affected me the most. Fighting with my father, being kicked out and living on the streets, going to jail, being put in a psychiatric ward, being embarrassed all the time, just because of who my parents are. The pressure that came with that set off a time-bomb in my head. I never asked for any of this, I never wanted any attention.”</p><h2 id=h-redmond-s-arrests-and-legal-troubles data-injectable=false>Redmond’s arrests and legal troubles</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=575 data-injectable=true>Redmond’s bad behavior caught up with him in 2018.

The suspect fled store on foot … officers found the knife and cash in [O’Neal’s] possession.”</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true>Redmond was arrested on May 8, 2018, and charged with one count of attempted murder, two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, one count of criminal threats, one count of brandishing a knife, and one count of battery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>In October of 2019, Redmond was ruled mentally “incompetent” to stand trial by a commissioner.
