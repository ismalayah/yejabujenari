Strong played the chipper, Texan cartoon timepiece in the hit Marvel Studios series’ first season, and is due to reprise her role in season 2, currently airing on Disney Plus.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=454 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>Unfortunately, what should’ve been her triumphant return to the Marvel universe has been overshadowed by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a vocal backlash against the actress on social media</a>, following Strong’s outspoken pro-Israel views following the Hamas attack. In the wake of the controversy, Strong has already been removed from one upcoming project, so we’re left to wonder if her time as Miss Minutes in the MCU could potentially be drawing to a close as well.</p><h2 id=h-tara-strong-has-been-recast-in-boxtown-but-will-marvel-studios-follow-suit data-injectable=false>Tara Strong has been recast in Boxtown, but will Marvel Studios follow suit?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/loki-season-2-miss-minutes.jpg><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=744 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s been reported</a> that Tara Strong has been removed from upcoming noir-themed adult animation Boxtown. Although she was due to play the leading role of Bill the Orphan in the series, opposite Gravity Falls creator and voice actor Alex Hirsch, Strong has now been let go from the show and will be replaced. No reason has been given as yet for the move, but the timing certainly suggests it’s in response to the current controversy.</p><p data-characters=458 data-current-count=458 data-injectable=true>Strong is an incredibly prolific performer, with numerous projects on the way, including reprising Harley Quinn in the Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League video game. Losing Boxtown is hardly a major blow to her career, then, but it could become a problem if this proves to be not an outlier but the first of a series of recasts and lost jobs. Perhaps whatever Marvel decides to do with Strong as Miss Minutes will set a precedent for how things develop.</p><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=true>As it happens, we can perhaps confidently state that Marvel is unlikely to terminate its relationship with Strong over this situation. After all, Loki season 2 is also home to Jonathan Majors, whose ongoing domestic violence trial has naturally caused considerable hassle for the studio on social media and yet <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Majors remains aboard as Kang the Conqueror</a>, the overarching villain of the entire Multiverse Saga.</p><p data-characters=477 data-current-count=477 data-injectable=false>With Majors’ own controversy much more publicized and discussed than Strong’s, we can make an educated guess that she will not be replaced as Miss Minutes for Loki season 3 (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">which we’re confident is coming</a>). Especially as Strong only strengthened her partnership with Marvel by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">replacing Miley Cyrus as Mainframe</a> in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. So, it remains up to other creators and studios whether they wish to follow Boxtown or Marvel’s example.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedlr%2B3sctomqitnJl6rbvKomSrnaChrqSxjK2Yq5ldqMGzu82gZJqrXaK2tL%2BMpqCnraSawHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fat-lip.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fat Lip | Sum 41 Lyrics, Meaning &amp;amp; Videos</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dragonslayer-1981.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dragonslayer movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1981)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./barry-game.html>Barry (game) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./danny-christner-death-cause-678732-html.html>Danny Christner | Death Cause</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./highest-paying-plasma-donation-centers.html>Highest Paying Plasma Donation Centers: Where to Find Them</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oran-k-gragson.html>Oran K.
