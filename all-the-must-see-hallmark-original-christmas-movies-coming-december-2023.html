Hallmark has been pumping out so many Christmas movies, that they now spill into the summer months to keep the Christmas spirit alive year-round. Now, with an incredible <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">42(!) new movies</a> scheduled for release this holiday season, it’s hard to choose which ones to prioritize.</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>To make your life easier, here are the 5 Hallmark Original Christmas movies that you definitely want to make sure you set your DVR for. Of course, if you’re part of the cord-cutters, Hallmark does have its own streaming service that the new releases will be available on as well, Hallmark Movies Now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Untitled-design-38.png><h2 id=h-round-and-round data-injectable=false>Round and Round</h2><p data-characters=624 data-current-count=624 data-injectable=true>Yes, this list technically is focused on Christmas movies, since that’s what Hallmark has focused on in the past. Since 2019 however, the December line-up of films have included at least one Hanukkah film. Their first attempts at taking on the Jewish holiday were criticized for making the films themed around Christmas with the main conflict being how the main character is actually Jewish and doesn’t care about Christmas. But last year’s Hanukkah on Rye was decently received by the Jewish community, and it seems like Hallmark might have finally found its rhythm for expanding its holiday celebrations.</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=299 data-injectable=false>Round and Round focuses on Rachel (Vic Michaelis) who is stuck in a time loop that leaves her reliving her parents’ Hanukkah party.

Starring Humberly Gonzalez and Ali Liebert, Friends & Family Christmas focuses on Daniella (Gonzalez) & Amelia (Liebert) pretending to date for the sake of their overbearing parents. Of course, just like every version of this we’ve seen before, as the two get to see the real version of their fake partner, the lines between real and pretend blend together.</p><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>Just as important as having the first lesbian leading couple in a Hallmark Original Christmas movie is the fact both actresses identify as queer!

As JJ tries to get through the first Christmas without her grandmother, Henrik comes into her life, and JJ discovers she has a troll figurine from Henrik’s hometown in Norway. Travelling with him for the holiday, just in time for his sister’s wedding the day before Christmas Eve, JJ not only solves the mystery of the troll, but finds out how to love the holiday again.</p><p data-characters=74 data-current-count=74 data-injectable=false>My Norwegian Holiday premieres December 1 at 8 pm EST on Hallmark Channel.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false></figure><h2 id=h-christmas-on-cherry-lane data-injectable=false>Christmas on Cherry Lane</h2><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=755 data-injectable=true>It’s always fun when a Hallmark movie decides to focus on more than one couple throughout the film’s runtime. Creating a Love Actually-style story where everyone’s lives surprisingly intertwine is a lot of fun. Plus, Christmas on Cherry Lane features some of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hallmark’s top talent</a>, including Jonathan Bennett, Catherine Bell, Erin Cahill, and James Denton.</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>Christmas on Cherry Lane focuses on three couples: One getting ready to welcome their first child (Cahill & John Brotherton), a pair who are empty nesters looking to move onto the next phase of their lives (Bell & Denton), and two who may be unexpectedly growing their family on Christmas Eve (Bennett & Vincent Rodriguez III), as they navigate the holiday.</p><p data-characters=82 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true>Christmas on Cherry Lane premieres on December 9 at 8 pm EST on Hallmark Channel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Untitled-design-36.png><h2 id=h-miracle-in-bethlehem-pa data-injectable=false>Miracle in Bethlehem, PA</h2><p data-characters=464 data-current-count=764 data-injectable=true>Hallmark Original Christmas movies are fairly non-denominational, though of course Christmas itself is seen as a typically Christian holiday. But <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in 2022</a>, their Christian greeting card imprint DaySpring decided to create a more religious Christmas film called The Gift of Hope, in hopes of appealing to a more traditional audience. DaySpring returns again with a new religious Christmas film, this time giving a unique take on the story of baby Jesus’ birth.</p><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=true>Miracle in Bethlehem, PA tells the story of new mom Mary Ann (Laura Vandervoort), who gets stranded in Bethlehem, PA with her new adopted daughter due to the weather.
