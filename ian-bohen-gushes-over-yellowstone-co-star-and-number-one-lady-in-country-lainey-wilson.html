He then proceeded to talk about her with hearts in his eyes, and honestly — we can relate.</p><p>“I just met her just about 12 months ago on set, and I wasn’t familiar with her music at all at the time, and when I saw her at the end of our first day of work, I said, ‘Hey, what should I listen to?’</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=528 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Yellowstone (@yellowstone)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=191 data-injectable=false>Wilson’s reply is very on brand for who she is as a person and a character, and as she told Bohen the title of the song, she looked over her shoulder at him, throwing the cowboy a wink.</p><p>“She said ‘Heart Like A Truck,’ and then walked away.”</p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true>Bohen says the moment took him back, and he immediately went to listen to the tune, which has been on repeat for almost a year now. He continued by saying that it’s been a joy to watch her from then to now — as she becomes the number one lady in country, as far as he’s concerned.</p><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=288 data-injectable=false>Landon also sang Wilson’s praises on the red carpet, saying that she knew she’d be a star immediately as she has the same star power as some of the greats like Dolly Parton and Reba McEntire; saying Wilson is the “real deal,” and one of the nicest people on Earth.</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=610 data-injectable=true>Of course, Wilson also got to talk to the press on the red carpet, and fans are crossing their fingers that her hopes for the future of Yellowstone will come true. While she has yet to receive a call about returning to Yellowstone, she’s not writing it out of the equation, as she shared with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Tonight</a>.</p><p>“I have&nbsp;a really good feeling that if they do finish things in a way that, you know, they’re planning, I will be back in it. We’ll see, they haven’t taken me to the train station yet.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=471 data-injectable=true>Speaking of the future of Yellowstone, Bohen is the latest to talk about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew McConaughey’s joining the Yellowverse</a> in a spinoff, and while he has yet to meet the iconic actor, it’s something he hopes will happen in the future.</p><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=396 data-injectable=false>“I’ve never met him, but he seems like a really great guy,”&nbsp;Bohen said of McConaughey, and he also shared that the cast should be getting back to work on the series soon, thanking fans for their patience in the meantime. With a series as powerful as Yellowstone, there are big opinions and emotions involved, and the cast and crew are truly aware of how special the series is.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqrc1mmaiglaN6qMHSoZysZZ%2BrsrN52J6jpaenqMGwusRmmqhlo6mus3nAp5tmpqWir6a%2BjKilnmWclrG6ecinZJynpaPBs8WMpZiippWueri1y6ymp2c%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pilar-bardem-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-99810-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pilar Bardem Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./233835-the-jamie-foxx-shows-garcelle-beauvais-c-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Here's How 'The Jamie Foxx Show' Star Garcelle Beauvais Celebrated Her Twin Sons' 13th Birthday</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./barry-game.html>Barry (game) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./danny-christner-death-cause-678732-html.html>Danny Christner | Death Cause</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./highest-paying-plasma-donation-centers.html>Highest Paying Plasma Donation Centers: Where to Find Them</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oran-k-gragson.html>Oran K.
