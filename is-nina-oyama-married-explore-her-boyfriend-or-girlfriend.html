And she is in full support of them.</p><p>Nina also got involved in ballet dancing. But her dancing journey ended too soon as she broke her knee at the dance company’s annual Christmas Concert.</p><p>Talking about her education, Oyama attended North Sydney Girls High School. Afterward, she went on to study communications and theatre media at Charles Sturt University in Bathurst, New South Wales.</p><p>Oyama began performing stand-up comedy at 17 years old. Today, she is doing great in her career. She directed, co-wrote, and co-starred in The Angus Project. It is a web series and television pilot that aired on ABC iview&nbsp;in 2018.</p><p>Oyama is currently a writer on Yolo Crystal Fantasy and is also on The Weekly TV.</p><p>Nina is also popular on Instagram.
