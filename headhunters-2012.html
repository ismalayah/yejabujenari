While interviewing job candidates, he learns information that's invaluable in his second job, as an art thief. He needs the money and tells us why: He's keenly aware that he stands 5-foot-6 and is married to Diana, a statuesque blond. On her he lavishes expensive gifts and a luxurious lifestyle and even sets her up with her own art gallery. He doesn't believe she could love him for himself.</p><p>Brown (<a href=#>Aksel Hennie</a>) is a smooth-talking type with the cool nerve necessary to enter homes and replace valuable paintings with deceptive reproductions. At a gallery opening, Diane (Synnøve Macody Lund) introduces him to a new client: Clas Greve (<a href=#>Nikolaj Coster-Waldau</a>). This man looks like trouble. Tall, chiseled, confident, he has just resigned as CEO of a multinational, and Brown would like to recruit him for a rival firm. He's persuasive. He won't stop until the man agrees to lunch.</p><p>Greve, as it turns out, inherited a Rubens from his grandmother. Perfect. Brown can place him with the firm and steal his painting. But when he learns the devastating news that Diana and Clas have been having an affair, he sabotages the job offer. Clas Greve is not a man you want to cross. Trained as a military commando, survivor of Bolivian torture, fiercely proud, he wants revenge. He's the sort of villain that a thriller needs: intelligent and remorseless. Not a gimmick character, but an implacable enemy.</p><p>Enough about the plot. What "Headhunters" has done, skillfully, is enlist our sympathy with Roger Brown and our interest in Clas Greve. They're not simply plot markers. And Diane is not simply a trophy blond, but warm and nice, and if she had an affair, well, so did Roger — with Lotte (Julie Ølgaard), who he treats with disturbing callousness. We've seen Clas in a dressing room, his muscular back criss-crossed with whip marks. We know, and Roger knows, he means business.</p><p>"Headhunters" then opens up into a long, punishing chase, as Clas tracks Roger across Norway in a series of increasingly perilous situations. The short man proves courageous and resilient, and can think quickly. His method for hiding in an outhouse from Roger and his dog is admirably practical. It's incredible he hangs onto his life. Yes, this follows thriller formulas. What is important is that it has the unfaked weight of reality. No fancy effects, but flesh and blood and real locations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46hnJqcmKq7tbHRrGRraGFn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./obituary-jacquelyn-fonte-homer-glen-murder-suicide-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Obituary: Jacquelyn Fonte Homer Glen Murder Suicide Linked To Death</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-was-young-thug-baby-mother-lakevia-jackson-instagram-account-revealed-256649-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Was Young Thug Baby Mother?
