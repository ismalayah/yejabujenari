Case in point, just a day after being named co-grand marshal of the 2023 Krewe of Endymion Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans, the organization has rescinded its invitation.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=519 data-current-count=519 data-injectable=true>Endymion president Dan Kelly released a statement on Sunday detailing the reason for pulling Gibson, who was to lead the parade along with Tulane head football Coach Willie Fritz, who led the team to a winning championship title in the 2022-23 season. Unfortunately, the reason had nothing to do with the 67-year-old’s controversial history of sexist, homophobic, racist, and antisemitic behavior — which honestly, should have counted out his participation in the first place — but due to unspecified threats.</p><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=436 data-injectable=true>“The Krewe of Endymion has received significant feedback about our grand marshal announcement yesterday evening. Some of this commentary included threats that cause us great concern,” Kelly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote in a statement</a> on Sunday afternoon. “In the best interest of the safety of our riders, special guests and everyone that welcomes us on the streets, Mel Gibson will not ride as a co-grand marshal for our 2023 parade.”</p><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true>Gibson’s career was derailed in the mid-aughts when he went off on an antisemitic rant against a police officer who arrested him for a DUI. A few years later, his then-wife Oksana Grigorieva released recordings of phone calls in which the actor made sexist and racist remarks, and he was subsequently forbidden from making contact with Grigorieva and their daughter due to a domestic violence-related restraining order.</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>However, in recent years Gibson has been making a comeback, particularly after generating Oscar buzz with his 2016 directorial effort Hacksaw Ridge. In November 2021, he was likewise <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">given the reigns to Lethal Weapon 5</a> in the wake of original director Richard Donner’s passing.</p><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=682 data-injectable=true>His inclusion in the Endymion Krewe was a bit of a head-scratcher to begin with, as the organization tends to court safer choices for grand marshal. KC and the Sunshine Band has led the parade four separate times, in addition to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">celebrity picks</a> of everyone to Dan Aykroyd and James Belushi to Britney Spears, Kelly Clarkson, and, in 1988, a team of Dolly Parton and Bud Light mascot Spuds MacKenzie.</p><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=256 data-injectable=false>Following Gibson’s removal, the Anti-Defamation League, Jewish Federation of Greater New Orleans, and Greater New Orleans Rabbinic Council <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">released a joint statement</a> expressing their disappointment with the decision to include him in the first place.</p><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=517 data-injectable=true>“There is still a great deal of pain associated with his name and deep wounds in the Jewish community,” wrote ADL regional director Lindsay Baach Friedmann. “His choice as Grand Marshal of Endymion was completely insulting and shortsighted.”</p><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=221 data-injectable=false>The parade involves as many as 3,200 riders across 80 floats every year on an approximately $8 million budget. At this time, it’s unclear whether Gibson will be replaced or if Fritz will serve as solo grand marshal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S6priMoKCbq5%2Bjeqy%2BxLCcZp2emcautc6nZKaZopm2brPRmqpmqJGnrqWxjK2fq52RqcBw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./patrick-wilson-american-actor.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Patrick Wilson Net Worth 2024, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brandon-jenkins-mma-his-age-and-wikipedia-details-meet-the-fighter-on-instagram.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Brandon Jenkins MMA: His Age And Wikipedia Details- Meet The Fighter On Instagram</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./barry-game.html>Barry (game) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./danny-christner-death-cause-678732-html.html>Danny Christner | Death Cause</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./highest-paying-plasma-donation-centers.html>Highest Paying Plasma Donation Centers: Where to Find Them</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oran-k-gragson.html>Oran K.
