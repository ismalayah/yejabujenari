TikTok does not compensate its users in full. Furthermore, she has only posted three videos on YouTube thus far. As a result, determining her remuneration is now difficult. Adam and James collaborated in March 2020, which drew a lot of flak.</p><p>There was enough for her fans to accuse him of collaborating with a “racist” and “predator.” Fans responded angrily only a few hours after James posted the video on YouTube.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYnZmdYr%2BixYybprKeop6yr7CMoqpmq5iaeqWt06KloGWRo8awusRmpqtlmah6tLTEZp6asV2brq61y7JkmqaUYsCmxNSao6KsqWQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./finding-amanda-2008.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Finding Amanda movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2008)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./review-the-boy-and-the-heron-finds-miyazaki-at-his-most-conceptual-but-it-is-still-ghibli-magic.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Review: The Boy and The Heron finds Miyazaki at his most conceptual, but it is still Ghibli ma</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./barry-game.html>Barry (game) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./danny-christner-death-cause-678732-html.html>Danny Christner | Death Cause</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./highest-paying-plasma-donation-centers.html>Highest Paying Plasma Donation Centers: Where to Find Them</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oran-k-gragson.html>Oran K.
